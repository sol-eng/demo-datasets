# Demo Datasets

⚠️ The data presented here has been intentionally manipulated for exploratory and teaching purposes. It should not be considered accurate or used for any practical applications. Please exercise caution and use it solely for educational or experimental purposes.

## Goal

The primary goal of `demo-datasets` is to curate and compile a diverse collection of small, easily comprehensible datasets that encompass a wide range of disciplines and subject areas for exploratory data analysis.

## Data Access

All datasets (CSV files) are sub-directories within the `dataprojects` directory. We've also compiled the final datasets into a duckdb database file (`database/demo-datasets.db`).

## Current Datasets (`dataprojects`)

### Environmental

-   Air Quality Data

### Finance
